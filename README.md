# Calculator
A calculator is a device or tool used for performing mathematical calculations. It's designed to automate and simplify arithmetic and other mathematical operations. Calculators can come in various forms, including physical handheld devices, software applications on computers and smartphones, and even specialized calculators for specific fields like scientific, graphing, financial, and engineering calculations.

## Description of making a calculator in Python 
The Concept I used in making this calculator!

A basic Python calculator is a simple program that allows users to perform arithmetic calculations through a command-line interface. It takes user input for numbers and mathematical operators, performs the requested operation, and then displays the result.

Here's a basic description of how a simple Python calculator works:

1. **User Input:**
   The program prompts the user to input the following:
   - The first number
   - The mathematical operator (+, -, *, /)
   - The second number

2. **Performing Calculation:**
   Based on the operator provided by the user, the calculator performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)

3. **Displaying Result:**
   After performing the calculation, the calculator displays the result to the user.

4. **Error Handling:**
   A basic calculator might include minimal error handling, such as checking for invalid operators or division by zero.
